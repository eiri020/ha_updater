Remote Home Assistant Configuration Updater

This project aims to use a remote development system (Visual Studio Code) for updating Home Assistant configurations files. Still it must be possible to make changes in the Home Assistant Lovelace interface, i.e. scene changes that are more convenient to be done in the interface.

Changes to will be managed by git, to enable history tracking and easy undo in case of failure. My git repository is hosted on my NAS server, but any compatible git system can be used. This project uses two branches: 

* master - the active Home Assistant configuration on the Home Assistant server
* develop - the branch used to edit the configuration

The update cycle of my Home Assistant configuration have the following phases

1. Edit home assistant configuration in Visual Studio Code on develop branch
1. Commit and push development branch to git repository
1. Activate develop branch on HA server, validate and restart HA server
1. Check Home Assistant server if restart did succeed (check log files, notifications and UI)
1. When ok, merge develop into master and activate master on HA server   

All actions could be triggered from the remote development system, although some intermediate steps could also be initiated on the HA server itself or from the Lovelace interface.

The scripts are made based on my specific setup:

* A docker based setup (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/)
* git is configured to be accessed through SSH, using public keys for authentication

# Detailed flow
For ease LAPTOP is my development system, HA the home Assistant server
1) LAPTOP (develop): Edit configuration
2) LAPTOP (develop): Commit and push (script ha_updater)

To make sure that all changes done through Lovelace interface on the HA server are in the repository, changes to the master branch should be committed and pushed

3) HA (master): Commit and push (script ha_updater => ha_push_master)

Prepare develop branch on laptop to perform a test run with new configuration on the HA server

4) LAPTOP (develop): Merge master into develop (will be the release branch) (script ha_updater)
5) LAPTOP (develop): Resolve conflicts if any and start over (1) (script ha_updater)
6) LAPTOP (develop): Commit and push merged develop branch (script ha_updater)

Load changes on HA server, validate and restart HA 

7) HA (develop): Change to develop on HA (script ha_updater => ha_pull_develop)
8) HA (develop) Pull develop branch to HA (script ha_updater => ha_pull_develop)
9) HA (develop) Check config with HA REST API (https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest) (script ha_updater => ha_pull_develop)
10) HA (develop) Restart with HA REST API (script ha_updater => ha_pull_develop)
11) HA (develop) On errors start over (1) (script ha_updater => ha_pull_develop)

Manually verify HA server (Lovelace, notifications and log files) to verify if the configuration is valid.

12) HA (master): Switch back to master on HA (script ha_finalize_maaster)
13) HA (master): Pull master on HA (script ha_finalize_maaster)
14) HA (master): Merge develop into master on HA (script ha_finalize_maaster)
15) HA (master): Commit and push on HA (script ha_finalize_maaster)

When you forget the manual switchback to master on the HA server, changes in the UI might be updated in the develop branch in stead of the master branch. Step 7 does some checking and tries to repair this, but not all cases, like merge conflicts) could be covered and need manual intervention.  
Keep in mind, the HA server should normally (except for steps 7-12) always be on the master branch.

# Scripts
For all scripts the following parameters can be supplied:
* -f => Force some actions, for example when changes are detected, first update the repository. Else processing will be aborted
* -n => Report (in some scripts) to the persistent_notification system of Home Assistant
* -c <config file> => location of .ha_config. 

## ha_updater [-m "Commit message"] [-d] [-f] [-n] [-c ".ha_config location"] [-s]
This script initiates the update of new configuration after each edit on the developer system. It perform step 1-11 and calls the other scripts (ha_push_master and ha_pull_develop) when actions on the HA server need to be performed. The script will not continue when it detects no changes (or changes are already pushed to repository), in this case use the -f force flag to override this behaviour

Can be runned on: developer system

Options:
* -d => will keep the branch to develop when script ha_pull_develop encounters errors

## ha_push_master [-f] [-n] [-c ".ha_config location"] [-s]
This script checks if there are pending updates (step 3) on the master branch of the HA server. Changes probably done through the Lovelace UI, like scene updates.

Can be runned on: developer system, Home Assistant server, HA Docker container 

## ha_pull_develop  [-f] [-n] [-c ".ha_config location"] [-s] [-d]
This script will pull the develop branch on the HA server, executes a validate configuration and finally restart the HA server to activate the changes (step 7-11).

Can be runned on: developer system, Home Assistant server, HA Docker container 

Options:
* -d => will keep the branch to develop when script ha_pull_develop encounters errors

## ha_finalize_master [-f] [-n] [-c ".ha_config location"] [-s]
This script needs to be runned after the HA restart to swicth back to the master branch on the HA server (steps 12-15).

Can be runned on: developer system, Home Assistant server, HA Docker container 

## ha_validate  [-n] [-c ".ha_config location"] [-s]
This helper script runs the HA configuration HA validater REST API with on the current active branch

Can be runned on: developer system, Home Assistant server, HA Docker container 

## ha_notify [-c ".ha_config location"] [-s] <-m "message"> [-t title]
This help scripts creates a persistant notification on the HA server

Can be runned on: developer system, Home Assistant server, HA Docker container 

Options
* -t => title of notification
* -m => message of notification

# Installation
* Clone this repository into the home assistant configuration folder. 
* Copy the .ha_config.default to .ha_config and change options
* Add the cloned repository folder to the .gitignore of your Home Assistant Configuration
* following software packages need to be installed, on both your development pc and the Home Assistant server:
  * jq
  * head
  * getopt
  * curl 
  * git
  * bash
  
(All these packages seem to be preinstalled in the standard docker homeassistant images)
* It assumed that you already have a git repository to host the updates (create a master and develop branch)
* .HA_VERSION should be in you .gitignore. This way the scripts can detect if you are running on HA server or the development system
* Activate the master branch on the Home Assistent server, activate the development branch on your development system

# Configuration file
All scripts will look (in this order) for the .ha_config file
  * file with -c switch
  * current working directory
  * ha_updater script directory
  * user home directory
```
ha_homedir=/home/homeassistant/.homeassistant
ha_host=my-host-name
ha_user=homeassistant
ha_api_token="long lived access token"
ha_http_protocol=https
ha_http_port=8123
notify=1
silent=1
force=1
```
* ha_homedir => full path of Home Assistant configuration on the HA host. Will be overriden with /config when script is detected to run within a docker container 
* ha_host => will be both used as hostname for the HA REST API and for SSH connections
* ha_user => Unix username used for SSH connections
* ha_api_token => Token generated under user profile to access the HA REST API (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/)
* ha_http_protocol => either be http or https
* ha_http_port => TCP port where HA is listening
* notify=1 => HA server scripts will create persistant notification in case erros are detected
* silent=1 => Script output will be less verbose. Currently still all output of git commands will be visible
* force=1 => Try to repair unexpected states (like behind with git repo, or wrong branch)

# Docker
Because of my docker setup, a few special considerations were needed:

* volume mount the homeassistant users .ssh folder into the container, to be able to use the public key authentication when you trigger commands from the Lovelace UI. Here is mine docker-compose.yaml:
```
version: '3'
services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: home-assistant
    image: homeassistant/raspberrypi4-homeassistant:stable
    volumes:
      - /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant:/config
      - /var/lib/dehydrated/certs/my-host-name:/certs:ro
      - /home/homeassistant/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
```
* git user and email need to be setup on the HA host in the home assistant configuration folder to have it both available within the docker container as on the HA host itself
```
git config --local user.name "username"
git config --local user.email "email"
```
# Actions from Lovelace
I added the following configuration to be able to trigger some actions in the HA Lovelace UI

```
shell_command:
  ha_pull_develop: "/config/ha_updater/ha_pull_develop -n"
  ha_push_master: "/config/ha_updater/ha_push_master -n"
  ha_finalize_master: "/config/ha_updater/ha_finalize_master -n"

script:
  ha_pull_develop:
    sequence:
      - service: shell_command.ha_pull_develop
      - service: homeassistant.update_entity
        entity_id: sensor.ha_current_branch

  ha_push_master:
    sequence:
      - service: shell_command.ha_push_master
      - service: homeassistant.update_entity
        entity_id: sensor.ha_current_branch
  
  ha_finalize_master:
    sequence:
      - service: shell_command.ha_finalize_master
      - service: homeassistant.update_entity
        entity_id: sensor.ha_current_branch
  
        
sensor:
  - platform: command_line
    name: ha_current_branch
    command: "git --git-dir=/config/.git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD"
```
