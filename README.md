Remote Home Assistant Configuration Updater

This project aims to use a remote development system (Visual Studio Code) for updating Home Assistant configurations files. Still it must be possible to make changes in the Home Assistant Lovelace interface, i.e. scene changes that are more convenient to be done in the interface.

Changes to will be managed by git, to enable history tracking and easy undo in case of failure. My git repository is hosted on my NAS server, but any compatible git system can be used. This project uses two branches: 

* master - the active Home Assistant configuration on the Home Assistant server
* develop - the branch used to edit the configuration

The update cycle of my Home Assistant configuration have the following phases

1. Edit home assistant configuration in Visual Studio Code on develop branch
1. Commit and push development branch to git repository
1. Activate develop branch on HA server, validate and restart HA server
1. Check Home Assistant server if restart did succeed (check log files, notifications and UI)
1. When ok, merge develop into master and activate master on HA server   

All actions could be triggered from the remote development system, although some intermediate steps could also be initiated on the HA server itself or from the Lovelace interface.

The scripts are made based on my specific setup:

* A docker based setup (https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/installation/docker/)
* git is configured to be accessed through SSH, using public keys for authentication

# Requirements
* following software packages need to be installed, on both your development pc and the Home Assistant server:
  * jq
  * head
  * getopt
  * curl 
  * git
  * bash
  
(All these packages seem to be preinstalled in the standard docker homeassistant images)
* It assumed that you already have a git repository to host the updates (create a master and develop branch)
* .HA_VERSION should be in you .gitignore. This way the scripts can detect if you are running on HA server or the development system
* Activate the master branch on the Home Assistent server, activate the development branch on your development system

# Docker
Because of my docker setup, a few special considerations were needed:

* volume mount the homeassistant users .ssh folder into the container, to be able to use the public key authentication when you trigger commands from the Lovelace UI. Here is mine docker-compose.yaml:
```
version: '3'
services:
  homeassistant:
    container_name: home-assistant
    image: homeassistant/raspberrypi4-homeassistant:stable
    volumes:
      - /home/homeassistant/.homeassistant:/config
      - /var/lib/dehydrated/certs/my-host-name:/certs:ro
      - /home/homeassistant/.ssh:/root/.ssh:ro
    environment:
      - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
    restart: always
    network_mode: host
```
* git user and email need to be setup on the HA host in the home assistant configuration folder to have it both available within the docker container as on the HA host itself
```
git config --local user.name "username"
git config --local user.email "email"
```
# Detailed flow
For ease LAPTOP is my development system, HA the home Assistant server
1) LAPTOP (develop): Edit configuration
2) LAPTOP (develop): Commit and push

To make sure that all changes done through Lovelace interface on the HA server are in the repository, changes to the master branch should be committed and pushed

3) HA (master): Commit and push 

Prepare develop branch on laptop to perform a test run with new configuration on the HA server

4) LAPTOP (develop): Merge master into develop (will be the release branch)
5) LAPTOP (develop): Resolve conflicts if any and start over (1)
6) LAPTOP (develop): Commit and push merged develop branch

Load changes on HA server, validate and restart HA 

7) HA (develop): Change to develop on HA 
8) HA (develop) Pull develop branch to HA
9) HA (develop) Check config with HA REST API (https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/api/rest)
10) HA (develop) Restart with HA REST API
11) HA (develop) On errors start over (1)

12) Manually verify HA server (Lovelace, notifications and log files) to verify if the configuration is valid.

13) HA (master): Switch back to master on HA
14) HA (master): Pull master on HA
15) HA (master): Merge develop into master on HA
16) HA (master): Commit and push on HA

When you forget the manual switchback to master on the HA server, changes in the UI might be updated in the develop branch in stead of the master branch. Step 7 does some checking and tries to repair this, but not all cases, like merge conflicts) could be covered and need manual intervention.  
Keep in mind, the HA server should normally (except for steps 7-12) always be on the master branch.
